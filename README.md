# Avrilbot.js
## A Discord bot that plays 24/7 Avril's music.
  This is my first project with usage of API's and my first time with NodeJS.
It was made in a quite simple way, just do to exactly it's objective.
Made with Discord.js v11 (outdated) and hosted on Heroku (Reference: https://avrilbot.herokuapp.com/).

## What it does
  This bot detects when someones login into a certain channel -my friends channel- and get in together playing some Avril Music. It was made to be a 24/7 Avril bot, just for meme.

### I actually deactivated and set it public right after the performance tests were concluded 'cause it was a "meme bot" and i think that this project may help someone.
